# Rust On Windows Guide

Quick guide to setting up rust development on Windows, since information I found was very confusing.

* Download and run [x86_64-pc-windows-msvc](https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/rustup-init.exe) from [Other Rust Installation Methods](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html) on offical rust lang website.

* It should prompt you to download and install *vs build tools*, install *Desktop Development with C++* from it.

* Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). Preferable to download the *zip* version, and you can make it portable by creating a folder called *data* inside its directory (instead of using the windows users "roaming" folder).
